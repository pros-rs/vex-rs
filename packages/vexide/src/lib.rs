//! # vexide
//! Work in progress high level bindings for the V5 Brain VEX SDK.
//! Unlike other libraries for the V5 Brain, vexide doesn't use an RTOS.
//! Instead, vexide leverages Rust's powerful async/await (cooperative multitasking) to allow faster and more user friendly 3dfcode.
//!
//! Advantages over similar libraries like PROS include:
//! - vexide is a real crate on crates.io instead of a template, or similar. This allows for dependency management with cargo.
//! - vexide has an [`Async executor`](async_runtime) which allows for easy and performant asynchronous code.
//! - vexide has no external dependencies. It's 100% Rust and every line of code is yours to see.
//! - vexide produces tiny and fast binaries.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! In order to get a program running, use the `#[vexide::main]` attribute on your main function.
//! ```rust
//! // Async
//! use vexide::prelude::*;
//! #[vexide::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     println!("Hello, world!");
//! }
//!```
